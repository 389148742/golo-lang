/**
 * Structure having a head and a tail.
 * <p>
 * This interface can be used to define any recursive sequence of object,
 * such as lists or generators. It is well suited to recursive algorithms, and
 * thus can be seen as an alternative to the {@code Iterable} interface.
 * <p>
 * For example, one can compute the size of such an object with:
 * <pre>
 * static int size(HeadTail<?> o) {
 *   if (o.isEmpty()) { return 0; }
 *   return 1 + size(o.tail());
 * }
 * </pre>
 * or in Golo:
 * <pre>
 * function size = |ht| -> match {
 *   when ht: isEmpty then 0
 *   otherwhise 1 + size(ht: tail())
 * }
 *
 * A {@code List} augmentation is provided, as well as corresponding special
 * methods on arrays ({@code Object[]}/{@code array[]})
