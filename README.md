# Golo, a lightweight dynamic language for the JVM.

> The world didn't need another JVM language.
> So we built yet another one.  A simple one.

Golo is a simple dynamic, weakly-typed language for the JVM.

Built from day 1 with `invokedynamic`, Golo takes advantage of the latest advances of
the JVM. It is also a showcase on how to build a language runtime with `invokedynamic`.

Golo was originally being developed as part of the research activities of the
[DynaMid](http://dynamid.citi-lab.fr/) group of the
[CITI Laboratory](http://www.citi-lab.fr/) at
[INSA-Lyon](http://www.insa-lyon.fr/).

Golo joined the Eclipse Foundation as an incubating technology project in June 2015.

## Getting Golo

Golo follows the [semantic versioning scheme](http://semver.org).

Go to the [Golo downloads page](http://golo-lang.org/download/) for general download instructions.

You can fetch Golo from Maven central under the `org.golo-lang` group.

We also provide [Docker](http://docker.com/) images based on Ubuntu 14.04 and Java SE 8:
`docker pull jponge/golo-lang` ([https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/jponge/golo-lang/](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/jponge/golo-lang/))

## Building Golo

### Dependencies

Golo is built with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). We suggest that you use
[Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org), too. The provided `Rakefile` acts as a frontend
to the Maven build and simplifies some invocations.

Golo needs Java SE 7 or more to build and run. We suggest a fresh build of OpenJDK 8 as
`invokedynamic` advances are happening there first, before being backported to OpenJDK 7
and eventually to the official Oracle JDK.

### Building from sources

If this is the first time you are building Golo on a machine, you need to boostrap a subset
of Golo, compile its Maven plugin and finally rebuild it all. Fortunately this is as simple
as:

    rake special:bootstrap

Once this is done you can use the common `rebuild`, `clean` or `test:all` tasks. All tasks
can be listed using:

    rake -T

Of course you can just call Maven directly if you like.

### Building the documentation

The documentation is located in `doc/` and is built using [AsciiDoc](http://asciidoc.org).

The documentation can be built using the provided `Rakefile`. For instance one may build a HTML
output using:

    rake html

#### Building documentation on Ubuntu Linux

You'll need to perform the following steps before building the golo-lang docs on Ubuntu:

1.  Perform *sudo apt-get install asciidoc python-pygments fop* to get the required dependencies.
2.  Uncomment a line in /etc/asciidoc/asciidoc.conf to allow use of pygments highligher:

```
#Uncomment to use the Pygments source highlighter instead of GNU highlighter.
#pygments=
```

#### Building documentation on Fedora Linux

You'll need to install the following packages before building the golo-lang docs on Fedora:

*  asciidoc
*  python-pygments
*  fop
