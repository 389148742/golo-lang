== Java interoperability ==

Golo aims at providing a seamless 2-way interoperability with the Java programming language.

=== Clashes with Golo operators and escaping ===

Because Golo provides a few named operators such as `is`, `and` or `not`, they are recognized as
operator tokens.

However, you may find yourself in a situation where you need to invoke a Java method whose name is
a Golo operator, such as:

[source,text]
-------------------------------------
# Function call
is()

# Method call
someObject: foo(): is(): not(): bar()
-------------------------------------

This results in a parsing error, as `is` and `not` will be matched as operators instead of method
identifiers.

The solution is to use *escaping*, by prefixing identifiers with a backtick, as in:

[source,text]
---------------------------------------
# Function call
`is()

# Method call
someObject: foo(): `is(): `not(): bar()
---------------------------------------
