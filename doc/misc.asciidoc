== Misc. modules

Not everything fits into the main documentation. We encourage you to also look at the _javadocs_
and _golodocs_.

The next subsections provide summaries of misc. modules found as part of Golo.

=== JSON support (`gololang.JSON`)

Golo includes the https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/[JSON Simple] library to provide JSON
support.

While `json-simple` only supports encoding from lists and maps, this API brings support for sets,
arrays, Golo tuples, dynamic objects and structs.

Given a simple data structure, we can obtain a JSON representation:

[source,golo]
----
let data = map[
  ["name", "Somebody"],
  ["age", 69],
  ["friends", list[
    "Mr Bean", "John B", "Larry"
  ]]
]
let asText = JSON.stringify(data)
----

Given some JSON as text, we can get back a data structure:

[source,golo]
----
let data = JSON.parse(text)
println(data: get("name"))
----

The `gololang.JSON` module also provides helpers for JSON serialization and deserialization
with both dynamic objects and structs.
