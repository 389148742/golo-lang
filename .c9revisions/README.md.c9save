A simple one.\n\nGolo is a simple dynamic, weakly-typed language for the JVM.\n\nBuilt from day 1 with `invokedynamic`, Golo takes advantage of the latest advances of \nthe JVM. It is also a showcase on how to build a language runtime with `invokedynamic`.\n\nGolo is being developed as part of the research activities of the\n[DynaMid](http://dynamid.citi-lab.fr/) group of the\n[CITI Laboratory](http://www.citi-lab.fr/) at\n[INSA-Lyon](http://www.insa-lyon.fr/).\n\n* Website: [http://golo-lang.org/](http://golo-lang.org/)\n* Twitter: [@golo_lang](https://twitter.com/golo_lang)\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/golo-lang/golo-lang](https://github.com/golo-lang/golo-lang)\n* Sourceforge: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/golo-lang/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/golo-lang/)\n* StackOverflow: [questions with the `golo-lang` tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/golo-lang)\n* Forums: [at Sourceforge, (email subscriptions are possible)](https://sourceforge.net/p/golo-lang/discussion/)\n* IRC: [`#golo-lang` on Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/)\n\n## Building Golo\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/golo-lang/golo-lang.png)](https://travis-ci.org/golo-lang/golo-lang)\n\n### Dependencies\n\nGolo is built with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). We suggest that you use\n[Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org), too. The provided `Rakefile` acts as a frontend\nto the Maven build and simplifies some invocations.\n\nGolo needs Java SE 7 or more to build and run. We suggest a fresh build of OpenJDK 8 as\n`invokedynamic` advances are happening there first, before being backported to OpenJDK 7\nand eventually to the official Oracle JDK.\n\n### Building from sources\n\nIf this is the first time you are building Golo on a machine, you need to boostrap a subset\nof Golo, compile its Maven plugin and finally rebuild it all. Fortunately this is as simple\nas:\n\n    rake special:bootstrap\n\nOnce this is done you can use the common `rebuild`, `clean` or `test:all` tasks. All tasks\ncan be listed using:\n\n    rake -T\n\nOf course you can just call Maven directly if you like.\n\n### Building the documentation\n\nThe documentation is located in `doc/` and is built using [AsciiDoc](http://asciidoc.org).\n\nThe current configuration depends on MacOSX + Homebrew specific paths. We know this is very bad,\nand we promise to solve this *at some point*. Or maybe we'll just switch to\n[AsciiDoctor](http://asciidoctor.org) *at some point*.\n\nThe documentation can be built using the provided `Rakefile`. For instance one may build a HTML\noutput using:\n\n    rake html\n\n## License\n\n    Copyright 2012-2013 Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon (INSA-Lyon)\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n        http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions from the community!\n\nCheck the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for instructions.\n\n## Credits\n\nBig thanks to our early testers before Golo was made public! *(in random order)*\n\nPierre Colomb, Olivier Coupelon, Cédric Exbrayat, Frédéric Le Mouel, Nicolas Stouls,\nHenri Gomez, Julien Viet, Philippe Charrière, Ludovic Champenois, Thierry Chantier,\nDaniel Petisme, David Gageot, David Festal, Gildas Cuisinier, Thomas Maurel, \nYannick Loiseau, Alexis Plantin, Sylvain Desgrais, William Guyot, Agnès Crépet, Cyril Lacote.\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":3884}]],"length":3884}
